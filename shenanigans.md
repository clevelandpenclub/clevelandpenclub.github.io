Things our club does during meetings that aren't just chat with friends and meet new people:

# Ink Sample Exchange

We have way too many ink samples somehow.
Feel free to bring your own, but beware that you may be peer-pressured into bringing home more than you brought.

# Pen & Ink Swap

It might be mostly Noodler's pens, but people keep bringing in their unwanted pens.
Beware that Amelorate has soft dibs on any Noodler's Ahabs and Neponsets to complete her collection of every pen Nathan Tardif currently sells.
Our sophants also keep bringing ink bottles to dip test, or sometimes fullout take.
Make sure to write a note next to your ink bottle saying so.

# Paper Tasting

At least during our first meeting, Michelle brought a vareity of paper types to try.
I'm not sure if that'll continue, but if you've got any rare paper please bring it in to try.
