In December (or perhaps November) of 2024 Pilot released a new special edition of the Custom Heritage 823!
Seemingly in lockstep with other pen manufacturers releasing winter special editions for the year (mostly Lamy), it's green and is titled Rikka[^1].
Unlike Lamy, the pen is a very dark green.
Being a Japanese Domestic Market-exclusive pen sold by only one retailer (I'm not sure if it's sold by CrossLand directly or some other seller on behalf of CrossLand), there are almost no pictures on the internet.
The [listing on Rakuten](https://item.rakuten.co.jp/bungunoarukurashi/4902505999598/) has only five pictures, one heavily photoshopped and the rest under artificial lighting.
Being the proud owner of such a pen, I decided to take some better pictures on my iPhone 13 Mini under difuse indoor sunlight and overcast Ohio winter lighting.

[^1]: On the Rakuten listings for the special edition Google Translate will sometimes translate it as Rokka, [but this is incorrect.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/1hnkaoo/npd_pilot_custom_823_green/m42xzvj/) The correct way to romanize the name is Rikka, which is also seen in [Pilot Iroshizuki Rikka](https://www.gentlemanstationer.com/blog/2024/12/17/new-arrivals-new-iroshizuku-inks).
