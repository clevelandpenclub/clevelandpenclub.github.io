title: "How To Get A Email When Someone Posts A Pen You're Looking for on /r/pen_swap"
---

Reddit's [/r/pen_swap](https://old.reddit.com/r/Pen_Swap/) is a hive of impulse purchases and FOMO.
The core reason behind this is the format -- Just one big bin of pens, ranging from $5 to $5000.
What if we could do better though?
Ebay has Saved Searches, where the website will email you if someone creates a listing for a specific pen.
However, reddit has no such built-in feature.
There is a way around it though.

TODO: Actually write the guide (i dont feel like doing it now)

TODO: Maybe also a segment on how to get an email when a pen you're looking for appears on the PenBBS Etsy.
