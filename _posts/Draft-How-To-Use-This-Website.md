Hey, it's Amelorate.
I wrote the backbones of the website you're reading now.
Unfortunately, I've got severe programmer-brain, so a lot of the things on this website don't really work the way you'd expect.
For those in the know, the words you need to know are that this is a Static Site hosted on [Github](https://github.com/clevelandpenclub/clevelandpenclub.github.io) [Pages](https://pages.github.com).
Comments are done using [Giscus](https://giscus.app).

For the rest of you, you're the target audience of this guide.

# How The Website Is Made

You don't really need to understand this part of the article to follow the other sections below, but [todo write the rest later]

# Comments Sections

To leave a comment, just click the Sign In With Github button, authorize the app, and you should be able to write your comment.
If you don't have a Github account, you'll be given the opportunity to create one.

## How To Get An Email When Someone Comments

Now if you really want to be involved, you can sign up to be emailed whenever anyone comments on an article or has something to say about the website.

In order to do so, first [click this link to navigate to the website's Github Repository.](https://github.com/clevelandpenclub/clevelandpenclub.github.io)
Then, you'll click the üëÅÔ∏èWatch button near the top right of your screen.

There's a few options for how many emails you'll get: 
All Activity will send you an email whenever anyone comments, makes changes to the website, proposes changes to the website, or really does anything related to the website.
Custom lets you select which things will email you.
We use Issues for things that are to-do.
For example, if there's a bug with the website or something that's incomplete, we'd create an issue.
Suggestions for articles to write would also be an issue.
Pull Requests are suggestions for the website.
For example, if someone's written an article for us that'll be a Pull Request.
The last feature that we use are Discussions.
When you make a comment on an article, it'll create a discussion and reply to it with that comment.
However, there is a sour point: If someone reacts to an article that has zero reactions and zero comments, it'll send you an annoying and confusing email.
Sorry, this can't be fixed.
I wish I could, but it's one of those things where everyone you complain to points the finger at someone else.
In the first place, there's nobody to complain to because nobody's being paid for any of this.

At the very least, I've got some screenshots of the buttons to press:
