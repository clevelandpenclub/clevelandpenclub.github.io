Greetings fountain pen locals!
Happy aftermath of Fountain Pen Day and Ohio Pen Show weekend!
Hope your pens and inks are bringing you much joy. 

I am excited to begin a pen club here in sunny Cleveland, Ohio.
You received this email because you expressed interest at the Ohio Pen Show.
I thought it was a wonderful event as usual!
I asked a lot of questions at the show and picked up some ideas for making our pen club a success.

Here is a Google form I created for initial data gathering: (form now closed).
Kindly take a moment to complete it so I can put together our first meeting, likely in January - or email/call/text me with any questions.
I look forward to hearing from everyone!

There is one Cleveland area person I hoped to see at the show, but he was not in attendance--Howard Edelstein.
If anyone has his contact information, please spread the word to him and to any other fountain pen lovers you know in northeast Ohio.

Thanks and I look forward to hearing from everyone!
