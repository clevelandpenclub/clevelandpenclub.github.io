Hello Cleveland fountain pen enthusiasts,

Thanks to all who attended our second meeting on April 27! 
It was a great crowd again with familiar faces and newcomers alike. 
I so enjoy talking pens, inks, and paper with people who love them as much as I do. 
Sean was a great sport to entertain us with a 20 Questions game. 
Following that, we were treated to a presentation by Howard Edelstein on vintage demonstrator pens. 
He shared a lot of great fountain pen history and let us see and handle some of these great early pens. 
He talked about books on fountain pens, among them Stuart Schneider and George Fischler’s two books, The Book of Fountain Pens and Pencils, and Fountain Pens and Pencils, The Golden Age of Writing Instruments. 
Another is Fountain Pens, Vintage and Modern by Andreas Lambrou. 
After our meeting Howard sent me information from Ranga Pens, a talented Indian pen maker. 
Their website is www.rangapens.com. 
Last, Howard forwarded me an email from the Central Ohio Pen Club in the Columbus area, which is holding a meeting on May 18. 
Their website is www.ohiopens.org. 
Thanks again, Howard!

Kat shared with me an interesting article on inks from Rick Propas, which I have attached. 
(Editor's Note: Please email us at [clevelandpenclub@clevelandpen.club](mailto:clevelandpenclub@clevelandpen.club) for a copy of this article)
I learned a lot from it.

Our next Cleveland Pen Club meetup is scheduled for Sunday, July 27, 2025 at the same location - Cuyahoga County Public Library - Independence Branch, 6361 Selig Dr, Independence, OH. 
As always, bring your fountain pen enthusiasm, your favorite pens, inks and paper, and a snack to share if you like.

If you have any questions or comments or ideas for meeting activities, feel free to send them my way. 
If you have any fountain pen related resources you’d like to share with all of us, contact me and I can put it in a follow-up email.

Enjoy your pens, ink, and paper. 
Keep an eye out for a reminder email in July about the next meetup. 
The information will be added to the website as well. 
Spread the word to anyone else you know in the Cleveland area who is interested in the club. 
I look forward to seeing everyone in a few months!

--Michelle
