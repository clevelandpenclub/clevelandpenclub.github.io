title: Cleveland Pen Club - First Meeting - Reminder
---

Hello Cleveland Pen Club enthusiasts,

The time has come!
The new Cleveland Pen Club meets Sunday, January 26, 2025 at 1:15 p.m. to 3:00 p.m.
The location is Cuyahoga County Public Library, Independence Branch, 6361 Selig Drive, Independence, Ohio.
There is ample parking all around the building.
As you enter the front doors, go left to the meeting room in the rotunda.
I know—fancy, right?!  

What to bring:
* Pens, inks, and paper
* A loupe
* A rechargeable desk lamp if you have one
* Optional:  fountain pen related items you no longer want or need for a "freebie" basket where all will be welcome to "shop"  
* Also optional:  a snack to share
* 
The agenda will be very simple:
a very brief welcome and introduction, then find a seat and enjoy the pens and camaraderie.
I am aiming for quarterly meetups and planning many fun future activities.

Feel free to get in touch with any questions.
Can’t wait to see everyone next weekend!

--Michelle
