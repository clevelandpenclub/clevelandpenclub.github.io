The (currently unnamed) pen club was first organized by M at the Ohio Pen Show on a single page of B5 paper to collect names and emails, and later sent out a mass mailer to collect info and opinions in a Google Form.
She probably still has that sheet of paper.
We haven't done anything yet, but we've got big plans!
