The Cleveland Pen Club was first organized by Michelle at the 2024 Pelikan Hub and November 2024 Ohio Pen Show on a single page of B5 paper to collect names and emails, and later sent out a mass mailer to collect info and opinions in a Google Form.
She probably still has that sheet of paper.

Our first meeting took place on January 26th, 2025 from 1:15 to 5:00 PM.
It was supposed to end at 3:00 but nobody was using the room after us so we kinda just stayed until most of everyone left.
About 15-20 people attended!
We had way too many snacks, too.
